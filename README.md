# A Linear Regression Analysis of the Relationship Between Poverty and COVID-19 on the State Level

- This repository contains files associated with the culminating project from the Statistics for Data Science course in the MIDS program at UC Berkeley.

- This repository was organized using the [Cookiecutter File Architecture](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) but the core of the project can be found in the `reports` subfolder. Therein lies the Final .Rmd notebook and PDF wherein I use data from the New York Times’ Coronavirus (COVID-19) Data in the United States dataset and the United States Census’ 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) to explore the relationship between Poverty and COVID-19 Deaths on the state level.

- This analysis was meant as an exercise for exploring the Classic Linear Model of Linear Regression using relevant real-world data. We spend a great deal of the final report discussing the assumptions of the CLM, examining how or if we are violating any of the assumptions, and how those violations affect our confidence or interpretation of the output of the model. Please do not cite this work as it is only a simple exercise meant for teaching purposes.
